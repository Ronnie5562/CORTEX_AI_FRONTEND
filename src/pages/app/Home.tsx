          Brain tumors are one of the most critical health conditions, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional methods, such as MRI scans interpreted by radiologists, can be slow and prone to human error. Misdiagnosis can delay treatment and negatively affect patient outcomes.

          The challenge is automating the detection of brain tumors (tumor vs. non-tumor) from MRI images with high accuracy. This can significantly assist healthcare professionals in making faster, more reliable decisions, especially when faced with large volumes of scans.

          We propose a deep learning solution that automates the detection of brain tumors in MRI images, classifying them into two categories: tumor and non-tumor. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this model learns to identify tumors with high accuracy, reducing human error and speeding up diagnosis.

          The dataset consists of MRI images, labeled as "tumor" or "non-tumor," which makes it perfect for training our model. Each image is carefully annotated to ensure accurate learning and validation. By using this data, our model can differentiate between images with tumors and those without.
